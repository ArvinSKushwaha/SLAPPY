"""The coordinates package contains classes that describe the curvilinear coordinate systems in which we solve
these partial differential equation systems. This provides functionality to support non-euclidean geometries as well as
non-cartesian coordinate systems. This functionality is given by the Coordinate class, which constructs a TensorField
defining the geometry of the space in which the systems resides."""
